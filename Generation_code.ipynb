It commonly happens as we are waking up and this is called hypnopompic or postdormital sleep. This occurs because during sleep we shift through different stages such REM (Rapid Eye Movement) and NREM (Non Rapid Eye Movement) sleep. During NREM stage, we sleep deeply, this is when the body does its rejuvenating by relaxing muscles. This is followed by the REM stage where our brain has similar activity as when we are awake. REM is characterised by rapid side to side eye movements and detailed, vivid dreams but the body remains in lockdown mode to prevent us from acting out these dreams as they could prove dangerous. Sometimes our brain becomes aware before we slip out of the REM phase and that's when we cannot move or speak.\"]\n",
      "When we fall asleep we gradually lose consciousness and our muscles relax and loosen up but sometimes during this period the brain remains aware and doesn't shut down and that's when we experience sleep paralysis where we are unable to move or speak but are aware. It commonly happens as we are waking up and this is called hypnopompic or postdormital sleep. This occurs because during sleep we shift through different stages such REM (Rapid Eye Movement) and NREM (Non Rapid Eye Movement) sleep. During NREM stage, we sleep deeply, this is when the body does its rejuvenating by relaxing muscles. This is followed by the REM stage where our brain has similar activity as when we are awake.
