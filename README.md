While running the code, Upload the train.jsonl and validation.jsonl files in the same folder of code if you are running in jupyter notebook or upload them if running in google collab.

Running Task2 requires some time as it requires training the model with data.

Also make sure that install all libraries(executed in code blocks) before running code.

Data present in jsonl files are described in readme file of project folder.
